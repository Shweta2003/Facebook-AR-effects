## Make your own AR effects which you can use while taking selfies on Facebook and instagram

### Steps to follow:

1. Install spark AR studio

2. Inside it create a new project.

3. You can experiment on your own face or go to the camera symbol and choose a sample. 

4. Make 3D to 2D object mode using mode botton on top.

5. Using the + sign you can add different scene understandings to add different pictues or animations to your selfie screen.

6. Once a scene is created you find a chess pattern box on screen and you can move it as you please.

7. On the right side you see many options to modify the scene you made.

8. On the Materials column click on + and a new material is added to your assets section.

9. In the assets either you can directly drag or import pictures and animations you want to add.

10. So scene specifies the position and assets define what to do inside the scene.

11. Click on the mateial option under assets and on right side in the textures option you can either select colour or the picture you want to add. So for every new image you want to add, you need a new scene and a new matrial. A material can be used on multiple scenes for identical effect.

12. But the images with background don't look good. To remove background from an image, use https://www.remove.bg/upload site.

13. Once you are ready with your new effect, go to publish button and bottom right, choose publish new effect and record a 10 seconds video with the effect. Then upload , if it asks for experience just add it. 

14. A new web page will open where fill the required details and when you click on publish, BOOM! your work is done and it will show your work is sent for review if it has no errors.

15. You will get notification in few days when the procedures are completed. Use your effect and have fun!
